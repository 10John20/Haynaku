      <p>Coron is a municipality in Palawan, known for its stunning landscapes and as a gateway to nearby diving spots. It has caught the attention of many due to its World War II wreck diving spots, beautiful rock formations, and unbelievably clear waters. It is also considered the more quiet and laidback sibling of El Nido, another famous Palawan destination because of its gorgeous waters and scenery.</p>
